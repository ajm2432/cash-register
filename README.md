Cash register python project
******************************************************
This is a simple project to calculate change after a 
purchase This calculator will allow you to 'shop' by 
inputing 'product prices' into the program. The 
program will also keep a current running total.You can 
choose when you are ready to pay by typing 'y' after 
the product price. If you do not wish to pay just hit 
enter twice after typing in product price.The program
is on a loop for maximum fun! unless it crashes due to
invalid user inputs.
